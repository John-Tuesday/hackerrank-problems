## Problem (brief)
There are N fences. Though the contiguous fences have the constant width of 1 unit but their height varies. Height of these fences is represented by array H = [h1, h2... hN].

Carve out the largest rectangular area possible where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous fence. Note that sides of the rectangle should be parallel to X and Y axis.
