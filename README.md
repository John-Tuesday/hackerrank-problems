# hackerrank-problems
My solutions to hackerrank challenges.

I will put solutions to most of the HackerRank challenges I solve, skipping the more trivial problems.
I don't claim these solutions to be optimal in any way, but they should at least pass all test cases.
Occasionally, I will write notes to further clarify the challenge prompt or to briefly explain the solution code.

Challenges are grouped by domain.
